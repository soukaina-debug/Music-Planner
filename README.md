# Music-Planner
I introduce you to event listeners that will act on keyboard events. For example, if the ‘S’ key is pressed, what is the event that will happen? Each event will have a different code and action. Apart from event listeners, we will also learn how to add and play audio files. Note that we have added very basic CSS, as the focus here is on JavaScript. You will have to import your own sounds and background image for the program to work fully.
